polymorphism : one item used for different purpose
type :1 overloading
        a operator overloading
		b method overloading
	   2 overriding
ex :
    5+10=15
	"5"+"10"="510
if a method is defective or cannot be used inside a derived class 
it will take it from its base clas or parent class
data structures with pyp:
  the arrangement of data in a effecient,squential manner
  linear : array, linked list,queues,stack,matrix
  non linear : graph, binary tree,hash table,heap
static : array
dynamic: list stack,queue
linked list:
ex: train
as the name says list of item which are linked with one another
types: sll,dll,cll singly/doubly/circular
creating linked list
step1 create the node 
step2: partion the node with 2 segments data & none
step3: add value into the blank node
step4: mark the as head
step5: create the next node by following the above steps
and establish link b/w the nodes
display the linked list:
  traversal is required from 1st node till tail node inorder to display existing linked list
